A unique blending sponge designed to give you the best control over your makeup routine. Its soft pointed tip allows you to blend hard-to-reach areas evenly such as eye corners, brow bones and side of nose.

Blending Puff can also be easily used for makeup contouring over other areas on the face such as the cheeks and jaw line.

Blending Puff can be used wet or dry. It expands when wet and returns to its original shape when it dries up.

Available in five colors.
