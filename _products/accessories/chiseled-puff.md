Oval-shaped latex free sponge with double chiseled edges that works well in applying and blending makeup for that perfect finish. Use wet or dry to apply your favorite makeup in cream or powder makeup. Use the chiseled edge under the eyes and on the corners of the face to apply concealer. Use the rounded side to dab and blend makeup on the larger areas of the face to achieve that sculpted and airbrushed finish.
