This dual-purpose eye pencil is gentle on the skin during application, and doesn�t feel greasy despite its creamy texture.  While it�s got its glitter on, don�t let that stop you from using it on your brows�the glittery element actually helps make your brows look fuller! . This eye enhancer comes in five natural shades that will complement any brow color, hair color, and skin tone, as well as a brush for the brows.
