FS Cosmetics Relaunched as Features & Shades 

The makers of FS Cosmetics believe that the Filipina, with the inherent uniqueness of beauty, deserves to have her own line of cosmetics to bring focus to her natural beauty – a makeup line that is tailored to Filipina skin tones and will let the Filipina shine in her own light. 

The beauty of the Filipinas has become a rich tapestry, owing to the country’s history, influence and the dynamism of  the Filipino culture.   This beauty has been raved all over the world and has allowed the Filipina to conquer the global stage and be a trailblazer in her own right.         

Features & Shades seeks to offer makeup products to the Filipina that allows her to be authentic and highlight her innate, natural beauty, without the need to mask what she is not.   This has been at the crux of the philosophy of the brand in developing makeup that elevates the faces of Filipina – the Oriental or Chinita, the fair-complexioned or Mestiza, and the Morena or Kayumanggi with her natural tan.  Each shade of the Filipina is uniquely beautiful and no particular type of beauty trumps the other.  Features & Shades exists to serve this uniqueness with the range of makeup that is more akin to the Filipina skin. 

Thus, FEATURES stand for the Filipina facial features and skin tones as SHADES represent the array of colors that FS Cosmetics has made available in the market. Features & Shades were fused together to become the new brand name of FS Cosmetics to reaffirm its appreciation and embrace of the Filipina’s unique kind of beauty.  With Features & Shades, each shade of the Filipina, along with its nuances and unique is worth celebrating!
