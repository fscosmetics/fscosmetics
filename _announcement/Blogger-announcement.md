Coinciding with International Women’s Day, Features & Shades held a launch event, aptly titled “Beauty Rendezvous” at Bar 27+ Café at the BGC on March 8, 2016 with Manila’s popular and top-rated bloggers in attendance.  Highlighting the event was the unveiling of the  new face of Features & Shades – Celebrity Model Ms. Margo Midwinter whose lovely face is also on the March 2016 cover of  a newly-reformatted popular men’s magazine in the Philippines.    Guests were also treated to the preview of the new Features & Shades Advertisement Commercial showcasing the versatile looks of Ms. Margo Midwinter with photographs shot from the lens of Top-rated Photographer Sara Black. Hello 

Beauty Rendezvous was aimed at giving bloggers a chance to get up close and personal with the relaunched Features & Shades, particularly the brand’s wonderful range of products and their amazing qualities.  Features & Shades Owner Mr. Edmon Ngo explained the art and science of makeup, from which most Features & Shades product have been developed – a concealer that turns into powder form, suitable for tropical weather and not just for women but for men who need to look good in the camera and on the catwalk; a liquid lipstick whose built-in mirror and illuminating cap was developed as a nifty solution for women who need an instant beauty fix even while on the road and on the go, among others.
